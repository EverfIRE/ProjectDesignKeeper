# Workflow Contract

## Operation and scope choice

| Operation | Purpose | Normal end state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initialize` | Create the first Keeper-owned knowledge pack and project context Skill | Validated preview, then confirmed apply |
| `refresh` | Reconcile changed evidence with an existing manifest revision | Drift report, validated preview, then confirmed apply |
| `audit` | Identify drift, conflicts, missing evidence, and invalid records | Read-only report; no preview/apply |
| `distill` | Answer a design-context question or prepare a bounded proposed update | Minimal context; preview only if a write was requested |

Choose one scope:

- `files`: call `scan_scope { root, path: <each-explicit-file>, view: "files" }` once per explicit file, then page `scan_scope { root, path: <each-explicit-file>, view: "evidence" }`. Never substitute a common parent directory.
- `feature`: when a feature path is known, call `scan_scope { root, path: <feature-path> }`. When only its name is known, call bounded `search_evidence { root, path?, query: <feature-name> }`; scan only matches and follow only their evidence-bearing references. Report that discovered boundary.
- `project`: call `scan_scope { root, view: "summary" }` once, then page `view: "files"` for SHA-256 fingerprints and `view: "evidence"` only for evidence needed by records. Follow every returned cursor until `complete: true`.

## Evidence order

1. Read confirmed decisions and design documents as intended behavior.
2. Read tests, code, configuration, and assets as implemented behavior.
3. Search only for unresolved terms, interfaces, dependencies, and contradictions.
4. Preserve exact repository-relative path and one-based line evidence.
5. Stop searching when every statement is supported or explicitly marked low-confidence/pending.

This order does not make intent automatically correct. A mismatch between declared intent and implementation is a drift/conflict record.

## Initialize

1. State operation, scope, language, and intended write set.
2. Scan and search bounded evidence.
3. Obtain semantic confirmation for every new normative rule, supersession, or chosen conflict resolution.
4. Render every required document and the project context Skill from assets using those confirmed semantics.
5. Pass the final manifest object as `pack` with the whole write set to preview. Candidate overlay validation checks schema, links, records, evidence, source hashes, ownership, and manifest equality.
6. Show diff, conflicts, and expiry; obtain separate confirmation to write that exact preview; apply once.
7. Validate and query a small representative context after apply.

Initialization emits schema 3.0 only. A refresh of schema 1.0 or 2.0 first renders a complete 3.0 migration candidate. Copy every compatible field that already exists; infer only a Schema 3-required field that is absent from the legacy input, and only when unambiguous. Schema 1.0 may lack `kind`, `ownerDocument`, and `lifecycle`; Schema 2.0 already has `kind` and `ownerDocument` but may still lack `lifecycle`. Preserve IDs, approval, evidence meaning, managed bodies, history, and supersession; report ambiguity or an unrepresentable legacy value as a conflict before preview.

### Schema 1.0/2.0 to 3.0 lossless migration recipe

Treat the schema change as a mechanical, lossless migration before proposing any semantic refresh. Snapshot the legacy manifest and every mapped document first. For each legacy record, apply this mapping:

| Legacy value | Schema 3.0 candidate |
| --- | --- |
| `id`, `domain`, `scope`, `statement`, `impact`, `strength`, `approval`, `supersedes`, `supersededBy` | Copy exactly. Do not rewrite or normalize them during migration. |
| Existing `kind`, `ownerDocument`, `lifecycle`, `conflicts`, `openQuestions`, `module`, `modules`, `path`, `paths`, `summary` | Deep-copy exactly when present. Schema 2.0 already requires `kind` and `ownerDocument`; never re-infer them. Preserve an existing lifecycle only when it is Schema 3-compatible and satisfies the migration rule; otherwise report a conflict and stop. |
| Existing managed block | Copy the complete marker and body bytes unchanged, including whitespace and line endings. A navigation-only record may move to a compatible owning document, but its complete managed block remains byte-for-byte identical. Preserve every unmanaged human span too. |
| `confidence` | Remove this legacy field and set `assertedConfidence` to the exact same value. Do not lower it to an accuracy ceiling: validation may compute a lower `effectiveConfidence` without changing the preserved assertion. |
| `evidence` | Deep-copy the exact legacy array to `legacyEvidence`. Separately create typed `evidence` entries for the same provenance and meaning, with repository-relative path, one-based span, role, and excerpt hash. |
| `status` | Copy exactly to `legacyStatus`; keep `status` unchanged for a mechanical migration. A separately confirmed semantic change may update current status, but never its legacy snapshot. |
| A Schema 1.0 record missing `kind` or `ownerDocument` | Infer only when unambiguous; otherwise report a conflict and stop. |
| A Schema 1.0 or 2.0 record missing `lifecycle` | Use `{ "state": "active" }` when legacy status is not `superseded`. A legacy `status: "superseded"` becomes terminal with `reason: "superseded"`, `confirmedRefreshes: 1`, `0 <= sinceRevision <= maintenanceRevision`, and preserved successor IDs. Preserve reciprocal supersession fields. |
| Any other passthrough field or incompatible existing lifecycle | Do not omit, coerce, or silently rewrite it. Report the exact field/value as a migration conflict and stop before preview because the candidate cannot yet be lossless. |

Add exactly one separate derived header block to every Schema 3 mapped document; never nest a managed block inside it. Schema 3 navigation documents (`index.md`, `evidence-map.md`, and the archive index) contain zero managed blocks. Move a legacy navigation managed block unchanged to a semantically compatible owning document. If `kind`, owner, statement boundary, evidence role, lifecycle, or successor mapping is not uniquely supported, report that exact ambiguity as a conflict and stop before preview instead of choosing a convenient category.

The following is a minimal structurally valid migrated-record example. Its referenced predecessor and successor records must also exist with reciprocal relationships in the complete candidate pack.

Before `preview_update`, self-check every legacy ID: it appears exactly once; all existing compatible fields and the managed body compare exactly; no unknown passthrough field disappeared; `assertedConfidence === confidence`; `legacyEvidence` deep-equals old `evidence`; `legacyStatus === old status`; typed evidence retains the same meaning; `sinceRevision <= maintenanceRevision`; and supersession/lifecycle links are reciprocal. Confirm every mapped document has exactly one separate derived block, navigation documents have no managed blocks, and the complete pack has Schema 3.0 `maintenanceRevision`, archive metadata, and `dedupeExceptions`. Run `validate_pack`; any `migration_*` diagnostic means the candidate is still incomplete and must not be presented or applied.

## Refresh

1. Run `detect_drift` from manifest source revision to current source. Start with the summary and request `view: "details"` pages only when exact paths or invalidated records are needed.
2. Re-read only added/modified evidence and records whose evidence was removed or invalidated.
3. Preserve stable IDs for unchanged meanings. Create a new record for changed meaning.
4. Reconcile managed blocks while preserving human spans.
5. Increment a terminal record's `confirmedRefreshes` only when this successful refresh confirms the same terminal state. At two confirmations it becomes archive-eligible.
6. Run `analyze_redundancy` when records overlap. Obtain a per-candidate `merge`, `keep-separate`, or `defer` decision; bind rejected-pair exceptions to both content digests.
7. Obtain semantic confirmation for normative changes, render the final confirmed candidate, preview with `pack`, obtain separate write confirmation, apply, and validate again.

If the manifest revision, source fingerprints, target hashes, or changeset expiry changes after preview, discard the changeset and create a fresh preview.

## Audit and task distillation

An audit reports new, modified, deleted, and invalid evidence; orphaned/duplicate records; rule conflicts; broken links; and open questions. It remains read-only.

Task distillation calls `query_context { root: <repo>, query: <task>, paths: [...], modules: [...] }`: ordinary context contains only active verified records. If relevant IDs are withheld as stale or terminal, call `query_history { root: <repo>, recordIds: [...] }` and label them historical risk. Return only context that changes planning: goals, applicable rules, contracts, open questions, and conflicts.

## Archive maintenance

Archive only terminal records with two confirmed refreshes. A single preview atomically removes their managed blocks and active records, writes `archive/generation-NNNNNN.records.jsonl`, updates the derived archive index and manifest, and rotates history. Retain two complete generations; when creating the third, delete the oldest complete JSONL and append permanent tombstones in the same changeset. Never archive, relocate evidence, merge, or tombstone without explicit preview/apply confirmation.

## Confirmation gates

First require semantic confirmation when a proposal:

- turns an observation/inference into `required` or `preferred`;
- creates a new normative rule;
- overrides/supersedes an existing decision;
- resolves an intent/implementation conflict by choosing one side.

Only after semantic confirmation may the candidate encode `required|preferred` with `approval: confirmed` and reciprocal supersession history. Then validate/preview that final candidate, show its exact diff, and require a separate write confirmation immediately before apply. If semantic confirmation changes after preview, discard that changeset and preview again. Ordinary read-only queries need no confirmation.

## Release activation and stdio reconnection

Use a newly created, empty disposable smoke-project directory. From the release checkout, verify the exact package first, then activate it with three absolute roots:

```powershell
npm run package:verify
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/activate-installed-plugin.ps1 -PackageRoot C:\absolute\release\.package\project-design-keeper -InstallRoot C:\absolute\plugin-cache\project-design-keeper\1.0.0 -SmokeProject C:\absolute\temporary-smoke-project
```

Packaging captures at most 256 allowlisted entries to depth 16, with a 16 MiB per-file and 64 MiB aggregate budget. It binds reads to file identity plus high-resolution change timestamps, copies only the captured bytes, and re-captures the source before and after publication so a concurrent source change cannot produce a successful mixed-version package. Verification and installed smoke require the exact 25-file topology, cap JSON at 256 KiB, and use the same 16 MiB/64 MiB file budgets.

The activation script validates that exact allowlist and SHA-256 manifest without following reparse points or hard links. Authenticated Windows reads deny concurrent write/delete sharing, and the activation-wide deadline bounds directory, backup, process, barrier, and smoke work; live WMI queries also use an operation timeout. Once the first rename has moved the active install, every failure switches to an independent 30-second recovery deadline so a forward deadline reached at the failure boundary cannot suppress an authenticated restore; identity ambiguity still prohibits rollback mutation. It refuses a direct live Codex `node.exe` child whose exact command targets the active `dist/index.js` and reports every matching PID. Close that Codex task or restart the app; the script never terminates an operational Codex process. Its own installed-smoke root is created suspended, assigned to a private kill-on-close Windows Job Object, and resumed only afterward. Timeout or a 1 MiB aggregate output cap terminates that complete owned process tree, and rollback waits up to five seconds for the root handle, zero Job active processes, and both pipe EOFs. Staging holds non-delete-shared handles for the random root and every created subdirectory while it writes exclusively. It swaps by rename, runs installed smoke, restores the old active directory on failure, preserves failed-package evidence after a smoke failure, and on success retains only the new timestamped backup among backups that authenticate as the current exact package. A stable historical `backup-*` directory whose content fails the bounded current-package shape check is never admitted to cleanup: after its root and parent identities are revalidated, the script preserves it unchanged, reports its path and shape failure, and continues activation because that evidence is outside the swap inputs. A timeout, I/O failure, or uncertain backup identity remains a blocking error. Superseded authenticated backup and failed-staging cleanup first rename into a random sibling quarantine, acquire authenticated delete handles for the complete fixed inventory, perform one final exact-tree check, and delete only through those handles. That final inventory is the cleanup commit point: a later OS deletion failure reports nonzero and preserves the quarantine plus all remaining evidence, but already-disposed authenticated objects may be gone. Any identity, content, deadline, inventory, handle, or pre-commit deletion ambiguity for a tree selected for mutation fails closed without starting deletion.

An existing stdio client stays connected to the process it started; replacing package files does not hot-reload or reconnect it. After successful activation, open a new Codex task or restart the app before claiming the new runtime is active. `npm run smoke:installed -- ABSOLUTE_INSTALLED_ROOT ABSOLUTE_PROJECT_ROOT` is the direct verification interface. `KEEPER_INSTALLED_ROOT` and `KEEPER_SMOKE_PROJECT` remain only as a deprecated compatibility fallback when no positional arguments are supplied.

Installed smoke rejects a nonempty smoke-project root before mutation. Inside an empty disposable root it creates an isolated complete canonical Schema 3 fixture, validates it, scans its documents, rejects a modified signed cursor, previews one owned temporary output, and requires `apply_update` to fail without elicitation support. Cleanup starts only after bounded confirmation that the MCP stdio child has fully closed. The fixture and isolated cache roots are first moved into random same-parent quarantine containers, then the moved root identities and bounded file inventories are rechecked before fixed-manifest, non-recursive directory cleanup. The caller's root is empty again on success; any close, identity, hash, inventory, or cleanup ambiguity exits nonzero and reports the preserved evidence paths. Standard Node cleanup still has a final pathname check/use window inside its random quarantine; the Windows activation cleanup does not share that residual because it uses authenticated delete handles. This does not weaken the normal write workflow. A host with form elicitation must still obtain the separate exact-preview confirmation; changesets still expire after 30 minutes and must be regenerated and reconfirmed after expiry or drift.

## Failure handling

- Ownership conflict: show target and reason; do not replace the file.
- Human edit inside a managed block: surface a merge conflict and request resolution.
- Validation error: keep the pack unapplied and list actionable diagnostics.
- Stale/expired changeset: rescan/revalidate and issue a new preview.
- Missing or invalid evidence: lower confidence or create an open question; never fabricate a source.
- MCP unavailable: allow mapped Markdown fallback only for downstream read context; block all maintenance writes.
