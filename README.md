# ProjectDesign

ProjectDesign is a two-plugin Codex monorepo. It publishes Project Design Keeper for maintaining reusable project-design context and Physics Simulation Superpowers for evidence-driven physics development, research, analysis, and paper reproduction.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose | Activate in a new task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project-design-keeper` | Distills repository evidence into validated design documentation and reusable project context. | `@project-design-keeper` |
| `physics-simulation-superpowers` | Develops, investigates, evaluates, and reproduces real-time physics simulations. | `@physics-simulation-superpowers` |

Physics Simulation Superpowers is Unreal Engine / Chaos first. Its physics tasks 17–23 concentrate on Unreal Engine; other engines remain concise unless their physics systems are unusually strong, such as Jolt, PhysX, Rapier, or Box2D.

## Install from the Codex plugin marketplace

Add this repository's `project-design` marketplace at `main`, or upgrade the existing marketplace registration:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace add EverfIRE/ProjectDesign --ref main
codex plugin marketplace upgrade project-design
```

Then complete the Codex UI steps:

1. Restart Codex so it reloads the marketplace.
2. Open the Plugins Directory and install `project-design-keeper`, `physics-simulation-superpowers`, or both.
3. Create a new task after installation; the task that performed the installation does not hot-refresh newly installed plugins.
4. Activate the installed plugin in that new task with `@project-design-keeper` or `@physics-simulation-superpowers`.

You can then invoke a plugin skill directly, for example `$distill-project-design`, `$unreal-chaos-physics`, `$surveying-real-time-physics-research`, or `$reproducing-simulation-papers`.

## Repository layout and maintenance boundary

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | The `project-design` marketplace catalog for both plugins. |
| `sources/project-design-keeper/` | Hand-maintained TypeScript source, tests, build scripts, and package metadata for Keeper. |
| `sources/physics-simulation-superpowers/` | Hand-maintained physics skills, research resources, tests, validators, and packaging source. |
| `plugins/project-design-keeper/` | Deterministic, installable Keeper release tree. |
| `plugins/physics-simulation-superpowers/` | Deterministic, installable physics release tree. |
| `test/distribution.test.mjs` | Repository-wide source/release, marketplace, artifact, and CI contracts. |

For plugin content, `sources/*` is the only hand-maintained source of release bytes. The `plugins/*` directories are deterministic installable outputs produced from their matching source trees and committed so the marketplace can install them. Do not hand-edit `plugins/*`; change the corresponding `sources/*` tree, regenerate the release, and verify byte parity.

Generated ZIP files and `SHA256SUMS.txt` are GitHub Release assets, not tracked repository files.

## Build and verify

Project Design Keeper requires Node.js 20 or newer:

```powershell
cd sources/project-design-keeper
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run test:ci
npm run build
npm run smoke
npm run package:verify
```

Run the repository distribution contract from the repository root:

```powershell
node --test test/distribution.test.mjs
```

Run the physics suite from its source root with Python 3.11 or newer:

```powershell
cd sources/physics-simulation-superpowers
python -X utf8 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -q
python -X utf8 -m unittest tests.test_repository_distribution -q
```
