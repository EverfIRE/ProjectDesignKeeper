# Keeper Tool Contract

Use exactly these nine native tools. Pass a repository root/path and repository-relative evidence paths; never invent absolute paths for pack records.

| Tool | Role | Essential result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scan_scope` | Read a bounded scope | Bounded summary or cursor-paged files/evidence for one immutable snapshot |
| `search_evidence` | Search the scanned repository | Matching repository-relative paths, one-based lines, text; optional domain/status filters |
| `detect_drift` | Compare source with a prior snapshot/manifest | Summary counts and invalidated IDs; optional cursor-paged details |
| `query_context` | Load current task/path/module context | Active verified records plus withheld stale/unverified/terminal IDs and reasons |
| `query_history` | Inspect non-current knowledge | Stale active, terminal, two retained archive generations, and opt-in tombstones |
| `analyze_redundancy` | Recall possible semantic overlap | Snapshot-bound 30-minute candidates and recommended survivors for explicit decisions |
| `preview_update` | Validate and stage proposed managed changes in Keeper cache | Diff, conflicts, `changesetId`, creation/expiry time; no project write |
| `apply_update` | Commit one confirmed changeset | Applied paths and recovery snapshot metadata, or a stale/conflict error |
| `validate_pack` | Check schema and repository-backed integrity | Valid flag, errors, and warnings for links, IDs, records, evidence, ownership |

## Read sequence

Call `scan_scope` with `view: "summary"` first. Use bounded pages and never reuse a cursor across snapshot, scope, view, or filters. Use `detect_drift` before refresh. Call `query_context { root: <repo>, query: <task>, paths: [...], modules: [...] }` with only relevant paths/modules. It never returns stale content; retrieve specifically withheld IDs through `query_history`. Use `analyze_redundancy` only for candidate recall and obtain a user decision for every candidate before preview.

`validate_pack` receives the candidate canonical pack plus repository root. Resolve every diagnostic before presenting a pack as valid; report warnings that represent genuine uncertainty.

## Preview and apply

`preview_update` accepts only writes under `docs/project-design/` and `.agents/skills/project-design-context/`. Any project-design change includes the exact final Schema 3.0 `pack`. Managed-block deletion supports physical archive moves. Archive JSONL is restricted to the archive directory and validated with its manifest metadata. Redundancy decisions must reference the unexpired snapshot-bound analysis. Preview validates the complete overlay before storing an external changeset.

A changeset expires exactly 30 minutes after creation. Present its diff and conflicts, then obtain explicit confirmation. Invoke `apply_update` by `changesetId` only after confirmation. Apply rejects expired, missing, tampered, or stale changesets and target/source/manifest drift. Create a new preview after any rejection; do not retry an old changeset as though it were current.

Apply writes atomically and retains bounded recovery snapshots, but recovery does not replace confirmation or concurrency checks. In the Harness, `apply_update` routes confirmation through the session approval seam and, by default, requires the human to type the final eight hexadecimal digest characters of the changeset diff; a declined, cancelled, unavailable, or mismatched confirmation fails the apply closed.

## Degraded mode

If the keeper tools are unavailable:

- ordinary downstream context may read `docs/project-design/index.md` first and follow its mapped Markdown links;
- initialization, refresh, validation-for-write, preview, apply, and maintenance stop explicitly;
- do not recreate transaction behavior with direct file writes.
